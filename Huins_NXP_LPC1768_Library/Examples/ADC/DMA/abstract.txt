@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to use ADC conversions and transfer converted data by using DMA.
	Process:
		Because the potentiometer on different board connect to different ADC channel, so we have to configure correct 
		ADC channel on each board respectively. In this case, 
			- If using MCB1700 board: ADC is configured to convert signal on channel 2
			- If using IAR-LPC1768-KS board: ADC is configured to convert signal on channel 5
		DMA channel 0 was configured in this example.
		The ADC conversion rate is 200KHz. A fully accurate conversion requires 65 of these clocks. 
		So ADC clock = 200KHz * 65 = 13MHz.
		Note: maximum ADC clock input is 13MHz.  
		
		ADC will generate interrupt at the end of each conversion. It will make a request for DMA source to transfer
		the converted data from ADC data register "AD0DR" to "adc_value" variable.
		After display this data into serial display via UART0, DMA re-setup for next transfer.
		
		Turn potentiometer to change ADC signal input.

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 vers.1
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- VDDIO: ON
				- VDDREGS: ON 
				- VBUS: ON
				- AD0.2: ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
			IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- PWR_SEL: depend on power source
				- DBG_EN : ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
				
	Serial display configuration: (e.g: TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
		– 115200bps 
		– 8 data bit 
		– No parity 
		– 1 stop bit 
		– No flow control 
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
		to be connected:
			- MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1:
				+ RST: ON
				+ ISP: ON
			- IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A:
				+ RST_E: ON
				+ ISP_E: ON
		
		(Please reference "LPC1000 Software Development Toolchain" - chapter 4 "Creating and working with
		LPC1000CMSIS project" for more information)
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Choose working board by uncomment correct defined board in adc_dma_test.c file
			+ If using MCB1700 board, uncomment "#define MCB_LPC_1768"
			+ If using IAR-LPC1768-KS board, uncomment "#define MCB_LPC_1768"
			(Should not uncomment both symbols at the same time)
		- Step 2: Build example.
		- Step 3: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 4: Connect UART0 on this board to COM port on your computer
		- Step 5: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
		- Step 6: Run example, turn potetiometer and observe data on serial display
		
		(Pls see "LPC17xx Example Description" document - chapter "Examples > ADC > DMA"
		for more details)
		
@Tip:
	- Open \EWARM\*.eww project file to run example on IAR
	- Open \RVMDK\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
