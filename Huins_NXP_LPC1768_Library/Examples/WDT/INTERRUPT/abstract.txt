@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to use WDT to generate interrupt after a specific time.
	Process:
		In this example, WDT disables reset function, WDT just generates interrupt when the 
		Watchdog times out. 
		WDT setting:
			- clock source: IRC (Internal RC oscillator)
			- time-out = 5000000us = 5s
		Before WDT interrupt, current value of Watchdog timer will be written continuously 
		into serial display (these value will be decreased from 5000000 to 0). After 5s, 
		the Watchdog timer times out, WDT interrupt sevice routine 'WDT_IRQHandler( )' will
		be invoked to change 'wdt_flag'. The notice sentence will be display and LED begin blinky.
		
		Note that: dispaly data via UART will caused delay.

	\Keil:	includes RVMDK (Keil)project and configuration files 
	 
	lpc17xx_libcfg.h: Library configuration file - include needed driver library for this example 
	makefile: Example's makefile (to build with GNU toolchain)
	wdt_interrupt_test.c: Main program

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 vers.1
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- VDDIO: ON
				- VDDREGS: ON 
				- VBUS: ON
				- LED: ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
			IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- PWR_SEL: depend on power source
				- DBG_EN : ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
				
	Serial display configuration: (e.g: TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
		– 115200bps 
		– 8 data bit 
		– No parity 
		– 1 stop bit 
		– No flow control 
	
	Running mode:
		RAM mode:   This example can be run on RAM mode with debugger. 
					All files must be build to .elf file, this file will be loaded into RAM through a 
					debugger tool before running 
		ROM(FLASH)mode: This example can be run on ROM mode with debugger or standalone after burning. 
					All files in each example must be built to .hex file. This file will be burned into 
					ROM(Flash) memory through an external tool (i.e: Flash Magic...) befor running.
					
					Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
					to be connected:
					- MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1:
						+ RST: ON
						+ ISP: ON
					- IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A:
						+ RST_E: ON
						+ ISP_E: ON
					
		(Please reference "LPC1000 Software Development Toolchain" - chapter 4 "Creating and working with
		LPC1000CMSIS project" for more information)
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Choose correct working board by uncomment correct defined board in main.c file
			+ If using MCB1700 board, uncomment "#define MCB_LPC_1768"
			+ If using IAR-LPC1768-KS board, uncomment "#define MCB_LPC_1768"
			(Should not uncomment both symbols at the same time)
		- Step 2: Build example.
		- Step 3: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 4: Connect UART0 on this board to COM port on your computer
		- Step 5: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
		- Step 6: Run example and observe data on serial display
					+ Press '1' to start WDT operation
					+ See the current value of WDT displayed on screen
					+ After WDT interrupt, the notice sentence will be display and LED begin blink.
				Note that: 	If using MCB1700 board, LED2.2 is available
							If using IAR1768 board, LED1 is available

@Tip:
	- Open \EWARM\*.eww project file to run example on IAR
	- Open \RVMDK\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
