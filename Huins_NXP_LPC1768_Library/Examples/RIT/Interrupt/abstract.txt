@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to use RIT as a timer to generate interrupt to drive LED
	Process:
		RIT time interval configure is 1000 ms = 1s.
		So each 1s, RIT will generate interrupt and invoke RIT_IRQHandler( ) to turn on/off 
		LED.		
			- In MCB board, LED2.2 is available
			- In IAR board, LED1 is available

@Directory contents:
	\EWARM: includes EWARM (IAR) project and configuration files
	\Keil:	includes RVMDK (Keil)project and configuration files
	 
	lpc17xx_libcfg.h: Library configuration file - include needed driver library for this example 
	makefile: Example's makefile (to build with GNU toolchain)
	rit_interrupt.c: Main program

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 vers.1
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- VDDIO: ON
				- VDDREGS: ON 
				- VBUS: ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
			IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- PWR_SEL: depend on power source
				- DBG_EN : ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
				
	Serial display configuration:(e.g: TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
		– 115200bps 
		– 8 data bit 
		– No parity 
		– 1 stop bit 
		– No flow control 
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
		to be connected:
			- MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1:
				+ RST: ON
				+ ISP: ON
			- IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A:
				+ RST_E: ON
				+ ISP_E: ON
		
		(Please reference "LPC1000 Software Development Toolchain" - chapter 4 "Creating and working with
		LPC1000CMSIS project" for more information)
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Choose correct working board by uncomment correct defined board in main.c file
			+ If using MCB1700 board, uncomment "#define MCB_LPC_1768"
			+ If using IAR-LPC1768-KS board, uncomment "#define MCB_LPC_1768"
			(Should not uncomment both symbols at the same time)
		- Step 2: Build example.
		- Step 3: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 4: Connect UART0 on this board to COM port on your computer
		- Step 5: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
		- Step 6: Run example.
			Note: 	MCB1700 will blink LED2.2 for testing
					IAR KS will blink LED1 for testing
					
		(Pls see "LPC17xx Example Description" document - chapter "Examples > RIT > Interrupt"
		for more details)
		
@Tip:
	- Open \EWARM\*.eww project file to run example on IAR
	- Open \RVMDK\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
