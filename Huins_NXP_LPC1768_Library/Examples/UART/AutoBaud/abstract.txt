@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This is a simple UART example using auto baudrate mode
	Process:	
		UART0 is configured as the default settings:
			- Baudrate set to auto mode
	 		- 8 data bit
	 		- 1 Stop bit
	 		- None parity
		After reset,  first, type 'A' or 'a' character to start Auto baud rate mode.
		Once Auto baud rate mode completed, print welcome screen,
		then press any key to have it read in from the terminal and returned back to the terminal.
		
		Note: If using this example to test with UART1, pls add conversion type (LPC_UART_TypeDef *)LPC_UART1
		because UART1 has different structure type
		Ex: UART_Send((LPC_UART_TypeDef *)LPC_UART1, menu1, sizeof(menu1), BLOCKING);

@Directory contents:
	\EWARM: includes EWARM (IAR) project and configuration files
	\Keil:	includes RVMDK (Keil)project and configuration files 
	
	lpc17xx_libcfg.h: Library configuration file - include needed driver library for this example 
	makefile: Example's makefile (to build with GNU toolchain)
	uart_autobaud_test.c: Main program

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 vers.1
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- VDDIO: ON
				- VDDREGS: ON 
				- VBUS: ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
			IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- PWR_SEL: depend on power source
				- DBG_EN : ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
				
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
		to be connected:
			- MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1:
				+ RST: ON
				+ ISP: ON
			- IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A:
				+ RST_E: ON
				+ ISP_E: ON
		
		(Please reference "LPC1000 Software Development Toolchain" - chapter 4 "Creating and working with
		LPC1000CMSIS project" for more information)
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Connect UART0 on this board to COM port on your computer
		- Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
		- Step 5: Run example:
					+ Chose any baudrate
					+ Press 'A' or 'a' to synchronize
					+ Press any key and see echo on serial display
					
		(Pls see "LPC17xx Example Description" document - chapter "Examples > UART > AutoBaud"
		for more details)
		
@Tip:
	- Open \EWARM\*.eww project file to run example on IAR
	- Open \RVMDK\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
