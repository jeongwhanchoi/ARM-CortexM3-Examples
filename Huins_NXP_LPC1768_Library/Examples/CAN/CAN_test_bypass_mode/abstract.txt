@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to test CAN operation by using bypass mode
	Process:
		Using 2 CAN peripheral CAN1 and CAN2 in same eval board to test CAN operation.
		This example just supports extended ID format.
		Both CAN1 and CAN2 are set baudrate at 125KHz.
		
		In bypass mode, AFULT will be disable, all messages could be received.
		One transmit message is initialized with ID = 0x00001234 and data = 0x00.
		CAN1 will send this message to CAN2
		
		Whenever CAN2 receive message, CAN interrupt service routine "CAN_IRQHandler"will be 
		invoked to receive message, print message's data into serial display via UART0 port, 
		increase message's ID and data for next transmittion by CAN1.
		This process is a endless loop.
		
		Open serial display to observe CAN transfer processing. 
			
@Directory contents:
	\EWARM: includes EWARM (IAR) project and configuration files
	\Keil:	includes RVMDK (Keil)project and configuration files 
	
	lpc17xx_libcfg.h: Library configuration file - include needed driver library for this example 
	makefile: Example's makefile (to build with GNU toolchain)
	can_test_bypass_mode.c: Main program

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested only on:
			Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 vers.1
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- VDDIO: ON
				- VDDREGS: ON 
				- VBUS: ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
				
		CAN connection:
			- CAN1-Pin2 connects to CAN2-Pin2 (CAN-L)
			- CAN1-Pin7 connects to CAN2-Pin7 (CAN-H)
				
		Serial display configuration: (e.g: TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
			– 115200bps 
			– 8 data bit 
			– No parity 
			– 1 stop bit 
			– No flow control 
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
		to be connected:
			- MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1:
				+ RST: ON
				+ ISP: ON
			- IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A:
				+ RST_E: ON
				+ ISP_E: ON
						
		(Please reference "LPC1000 Software Development Toolchain" - chapter 4 "Creating and working with
		LPC1000CMSIS project" for more information)
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Connect UART0 on this board to COM port on your computer
		- Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
		- Step 5: Run example:
			- Press "1" to initialize message and AFLUT 
			- Press "2" to start CAN operation
		
		(Pls see "LPC17xx Example Description" document - chapter "Examples > CAN > CAN_test_bypass_mode"
		for more details)
		
@Tip:
	- Open \EWARM\*.eww project file to run example on IAR
	- Open \RVMDK\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
