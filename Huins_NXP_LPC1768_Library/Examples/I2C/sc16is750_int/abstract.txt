@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to use I2C to communicate with SC16IS750/760 Demo Board
		in interrupt mode.
	Process:
		I2C is configured as master using interrupt mode.
		I2C Clock Rate is set at 100K.
		
		First, I2C send commands to reset, config direction, and validate value on SC16IS740 chip 
		in interrupt mode.
		Then, start to use I2C polling mode to handle SC16IS740 board.
		On serial display:
		- Press 'r' to print menu
		- Press '1': send 0x00 value to IOStat register to turn on 8 LEDs on SC16IS740 board.
		- Press '2': send 0xFF value to IOStat register to turn off 8 LEDs on SC16IS740 board.
		
		(Pls see two pdf file at SPI/sc16is750:
			- SC16IS740_750_760_6.pdf
			- schematics.sc16is750.demo.board.pdf
		for more information about SC16IS740 board)

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 vers.1
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- VDDIO: ON
				- VDDREGS: ON 
				- VBUS: ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
			IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- PWR_SEL: depend on power source
				- DBG_EN : ON
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
				
			SC16IS750 board:
			 	These jumpers must be configured as following:
			 	- JP2: 1-2 (I2C)
			 	- JP16: 2-3 (hard reset)
			 	- Remain jumper: OFF
			 	
	I2C connection:
			- SDA and SCL pin in two board connect in "pin-to-pin" style: SDA <-> SDA, SCL <-> SCKss 
			- Common power source 3.3V and ground must be connected together between two board.	
		+ For I2C0:
			SDA: P0.27
			SCL: P0.28
		+ For I2C2:
			SDA: P0.10	
			SCL: P0.11
				
	Serial display configuration:(e.g: TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
		– 115200bps 
		– 8 data bit 
		– No parity 
		– 1 stop bit 
		– No flow control 
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
		to be connected:
			- MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1:
				+ RST: ON
				+ ISP: ON
			- IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A:
				+ RST_E: ON
				+ ISP_E: ON
		
		(Please reference "LPC1000 Software Development Toolchain" - chapter 4 "Creating and working with
		LPC1000CMSIS project" for more information)
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Choose I2C peripheral by setting 'USEDI2CDEV'
		- Step 2: Build example.
		- Step 3: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 4: Connect UART0 on this board to COM port on your computer
		- Step 5: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
		- Step 6: Run example.
					+ Press 'r' to display welcome screen
					+ Press '1' to turn on LEDs
					+ Press '2' to turn off LEDs
		
		(Pls see "LPC17xx Example Description" document - chapter "Examples > I2C > sc16is750_int"
		for more details)
		
@Tip:
	- Open \EWARM\*.eww project file to run example on IAR
	- Open \RVMDK\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
