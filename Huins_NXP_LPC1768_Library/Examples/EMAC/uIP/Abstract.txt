@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to handle a  single network interface and 
		contains the IP, ICMP, UDP and TCP protocols. 
	Process:
		The uIP TCP/IP stack is an extremely small implementation of the TCP/IP 
		protocol suite intended for embedded systems running low-end 8 or 16-bit 
		microcontrollers. The code size and RAM requirements of uIP is an order of 
		magnitude smaller than other generic TCP/IP stacks today. 
		
		The uip_webserver implements WEB server.
		The default IP address is:
			192.168.0.100
		The default router's IP address is:
			192.168.0.1
		The subnet mask is:
			255.255.255.0
		IP address on your PC should not be one of these IP addresses above

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:	
		This example is tested on:	
			Keil MCB1700 vers.1
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- VDDIO: ON
				- VDDREGS: ON
				- VBUS: ON
				- LED: ON
				- E/C: 2-3 (Ethernet)
				- E/U: 2-3 (Ethernet)
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
				Use Ethernet Physical Layer Transceiver: DP83848C 
				MAC address: 1E-30-6C-A2-45-5E 
			IAR LPC1768 vers.A
				These jumpers must be configured as following:
				- PWR_SEL: depending of power source
				- DBG_EN : ON
				- ACC_IRQ/LED2: 2-3 (LED2)
				- Remain jumpers: OFF
				Use Ethernet Physical Layer Transceiver: FSZ8721BL 
				MAC address: 0-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF
				
		Serial display configuration: (e.g: TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
			– 115200bps 
			– 8 data bit 
			– No parity 
			– 1 stop bit 
			– No flow control 
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run only on ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
		to be connected:
			- MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1:
				+ RST: ON
				+ ISP: ON
			- IAR LPC1768 KickStart vers.A:
				+ RST_E: ON
				+ ISP_E: ON
		
			(Please reference "LPC1000 Software Development Toolchain" - chapter 4 "Creating and working with
			LPC1000CMSIS project" for more information)
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Choose correct working board by uncomment correct defined board in lpc17xx_emac.h file
			+ If using MCB1700 board, uncomment "#define MCB_LPC_1768"
			+ If using IAR-LPC1768-KS board, uncomment "#define MCB_LPC_1768"
			(Should not uncomment both symbols at the same time)
		- Step 2: Build example.
		- Step 3: Burn hex file into board 
		- Step 4: Use a Straight ethernet cable connect the ETH port on eval board to the router (that mounts your PC also)
		- Step 5: Connect UART0 on this board to COM port on your computer
		- Step 6: Configure hardware and serial display as above instructions 
		- Step 7: Re-config IP address on PC:
					+ IP address: 192.168.0.x (x != 1, 100)
					+ Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
		- Step 8: Reset board, monitor the status via serial display until EMAC initialized
		- Step 9: Open command prompt window, execute 'ping 192.168.0.100' command
		- Step 10: Open web browser, access to address "http://192.168.0.100" to display the content
		           of the webpage.	
		           
		(Pls reference "LPC17xx Example Description" document - chapter "Examples > EMAC > uIP"
		for more details)
@Tip:
	- Open \EWARM\*.eww project file to run example on IAR
	- Open \RVMDK\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
